<FONT SIZE="4">
Namodn is a small, not-for-profit orginazation dedicated to art in all
it's forms (Art, Writing, Music, etc.). Our goal is to incorporate
the many aspects of art into a business that can be of great use to
artists of all kinds. We give people the opportunity to express themselves
in a global medium. What people express is up to them; we
will not censor other people's art.

<H3>
<FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#FF00FF">*</FONT><FONT SIZE="4">We provide a place for
artists, writers & musicians to get their art on the 
  web for little or no money. From there people from all around the world
can
  view art, read poetry & short stories, or download and listen to music.
  If you want to put your stuff up for people to look at free
of charge (i.e. not trying to sell it), you will not be charged for the
web page. If you would like to sell your art, music etc. you must pay
a $25 setup fee, and a flat rate of $10 per. month (or $30 per. quarter).
The content can be sold through the mail (i.e. paintings, sculpture,
drawings, compact discs/tapes), or downloaded (mp3's, etc).
