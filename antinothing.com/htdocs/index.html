"Do you harken for the days when little Jimmy skipped merrily
 along, lunchbox in hand, to face a challenging and earnest
 curriculum of moral eptitude? Well, we don't support you
 in this or any other effort, but WE PLEDGE not to oppose
 you."

We oppose nothing. Our only wish ( it is NOT opposition! ) is 
<BR>
that someday everyone will join us in this view, even the
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.AntiEverything.com">more entrenched</A>
among us.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
Everyone truly is our brothers and sisters, and
<BR>
our bothers and sisters are truly everyone.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
We do not need to be an organized organization
<BR>
to strike a chord among the hundreds of billions
<BR>
of humans residing on this planet.
