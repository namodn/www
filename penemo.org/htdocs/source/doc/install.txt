        # cp bin/penemo /usr/local/sbin/
        # chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o= /usr/local/sbin/penemo

 | installing: configuration files
 \--------------

        # cp conf/agent.conf /usr/local/etc/penemo/agent.conf
        # cp conf/penemo.conf /usr/local/etc/penemo/penemo.conf

 | installing: penemo shared datafiles
 \--------------

        # mkdir /usr/local/share/penemo
        # cp -r modules/ /usr/local/share/penemo/
        # cp -r plugins/ /usr/local/share/penemo/
        # cp -r doc/ /usr/local/share/penemo/

	# mkdir /usr/local/share/penemo/data
	# chown <penemo user>:<httpd user> /usr/local/share/penemo/data
	# chmod u=rwx,g=rwx,o=r /usr/local/share/penemo/data

     penemo user should be root (run as root). and httpd user is
   whatever the httpd daemon runs as (debian: www-data, freebsd: nobody).

 /--
 | installing: html directories for penemo to write to and access images
 \--------------
	
        # cp -r html/ <value of html_dir in penemo.conf> 
  -note:
   by default html is located in /usr/local/share/penemo/html however, for
   example on my debian system, htdocs are located in /var/www/htdocs,
   i set my html_dir to /var/www/htdocs/penemo/ then I perform the
   following commands..
    
     (** example **)
        # cp -r html/ /var/www/htdocs/
	# mv /var/www/htdocs/html /var/www/htdocs/penemo
     (** example **)


 /--
 | installing: cgi functionality 
 \-------------

   this cgi is only used for web-based pausing and is not needed
   for penemo to function. if you do not wish to use the pausing
   features via the web, you need not worry about this cgi. 

     # cp bin/penemo-admin.cgi <your webservers cgi-bin directory>

  -note:
    by default cgibin_dir is set to /cgi-bin wich is the common
  alias for accessing cgi's, you want to copy this file
  into physical directory for your cgi-bin (/var/www/cgi-bin/
  in debian, /usr/local//home/httpd/cgi-bin/ in redhat).
