   2. Pausing
       2.1 when i click pause on the web interface, I get an internal server error.

1. Checks
-
   1.1 http check fails even though URL specified is good.
       In the agent.conf I have the line:
         http  url="www.somedomain.com"
       In one of my agents config. I know the URL is good,
       but penemo is failing on it.
  
       A. Depending on the http fetching program you are using
          (i.e. wget, fetch, or snarf) you may need to specify
          the exact file to grab. If you have problems, try:
            http  url="www.somedomain.com/index.html"
          or whichever specific document you are trying to reach.

2. Pausing
-
   2.1 when i click pause on the web interface, I get an internal server error.

       A. this probably means the webserver does not have permision to
          access the cgi. Make sure it is either owned by the webserver
          or its group, or that o=rx. 

   2.2 after I click pause, and enter the time limit, when I click submit, 
       I get an internal server error.

       A. this usually means the cgi does not have permision to write to
          the penemo data directory (where it keeps persistent agent information,
          like error levels, pausing info etc. 
      
          the data directory (by default located in /usr/local/share/penemo/data)
          must be rwx either with the webservers user or group. 

       ** it is not reccomended to set o=rwx on the data directory, that would
          allow any user to change internal agent data and pause agents for
          extended amounts of time etc.
