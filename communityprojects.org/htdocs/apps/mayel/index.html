	MAYEL is a text based mail client such similar to the standard
UNIX 'mail' program. Developed in PERL it implements a number of features
I've always looked for in a text based email client, such as simple and
built in filters (not as complex as procmail, and as well, not as utterly
annoying). Multiple account manipulation. In fact, with MAYEL, I take this
a step further for people with entire domain names to themselves, (i.e.
if you can receieve any mail sent to [anytext]@yourdomain.com, then when
you hit reply in MAYEL, you will send as whatever email address you were
addressed as. If used in a careless way this can be very insecure but I
leave that up to the user (preferably an admin) to deal with. Further,
more detailed and in depth, documentation will be released soon.<BR>
