			penemo 1.0 BETA has been released. The<BR>
			&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp

			&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
			0.7 and even though not all of the features<BR>
			&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
			planned for 1.0 are finished, this BETA<BR>
			&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
			is completely useable for most tasks.<BR>
			&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
			take note, the main unimplimented feature<BR>
			&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
			in this BETA release is the notify_exec.<BR>
