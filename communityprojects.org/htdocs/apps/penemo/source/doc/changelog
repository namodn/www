penemo changelog


changes from version 1.0 BETA2 -> BETA3
	* changed the html output a little, changed some font's and cleaned up 
	   some layout.
	* fixed a time problem with the penemo-admin.cgi (problem splitting 
	   date string).
	* modified the notification messages to be less "wordy".
	* made all the little LED's have transparent backgrounds (in case
	   someone wants to go and change the background to blaring white :)


changes from version 1.0 BETA1 -> 1.0 BETA2
	* notify_cap (specifies the cap at which to stop sending notifications).
	* html display for the configuration options set for each agent (link 
	   from detailed agent display).
        * yellow 'warning' light for when an error is detected yet a notification 
	   is not being sent.  
	* notification bugfix

changes from version 0.7 -> 1.0 BETA1
        * complete code re-structuring (using object oriented design
           with perl).
        * tier levels for notification 
        * resolved notification. send page to whatever tier it was on, to let 
           everyone know the problem is resolved.  
        * check funtion for plugins.  
        * extensive pausing features 
	* images instead of colored '*' for warning LED's (thanks to Mike Tuller)


changes from version 0.6 -> 0.7
        * now use Net::Ping module for initial ping check (instead
           of using the command line ping). Noticed problem with 
           RedHat 5.2 installs: the ping timeout param wasn't actually 
           timing out and therefore hung penemo. 
          

changes from version 0.5 -> 0.6
        * added ability to execute multiple command line arguments. (duh).
        * added two command line options, -rc (Read penemo Config) and 
           -ra (Read Agent config)both take one arg. which is the complete 
           path to the alternate config file to read.
        * small bugfixes here and there.

changes from version 0.4 -> 0.5
        * made http type in agent.conf able to perform several http request
           (unlimited) per agent entry (previously it was just one).

changes from version 0.3 -> 0.4
        * set ping timeout from 1 try, to 2. this makes script run a
           little slower if a machine is unpingable, but helps account
           for a possible slow ping response (resulting in a bogus
           notification).
        * added a ping_wait option in the penemo.conf to make the value
           (referenced above) changeable.
        * changed the command line args a little (run penemo --help to see).
        * added a new command line argument '-pc' (print config). prints
           a rudimentary display of the settings in the penemo.conf.
           (still need to fix it so it prints hashes of hashes instead of
           the memory address).

changes from version 0.2 -> 0.3
        * minor bug fixes
        * added 'community' tag in penemo.conf 
           (forgot to do this in first version).

changes from version 0.1 -> 0.2
        * fixed http://<url>"<search" function (wasnt working properly).
        * small bug fixes to avoid "undefined variable testing".
