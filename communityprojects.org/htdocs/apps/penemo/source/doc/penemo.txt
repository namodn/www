penemo version: 1.0 BETA3

Developed and Maintained,
by: Nick Jennings, nick@namodn.com


INTRODUCTION

 penemo is a remote monitoring program, written in perl. It is designed to 
 implement a number of check features such as ping, http, and snmp. A plugin
 method has been designed to allow you to add different snmp mibs to check
 as well as a more generic plugin method so that you can write your own
 script to check whatever you want and return certain values to let penemo
 know if the check was succesfull or not.
 
 penemo requires UCD-SNMP to be installed on systems that you wish to be snmp 
 polled, as well as the machine this program will run on (it needs access 
 to the snmpwalk command). However, None of the UCD-SNMP stuff is required 
 if all you wish to do is ping hosts and perform http requests.



SUPPORTED ARCHITECHURES

 penemo was developed on a Debian GNU/Linux system. And has only been tested
 with Linux and FreeBSD. However, it should theoretically run fine on any UNIX
 system that has Perl and UCD-SNMP installed.

 please send me an email if you have gotten penemo to run on any OS besides
 Linux or FreeBSD, so I can add it to the list of tested platforms.



INSTALLATION

 for installation instructions please read the install.txt


CONFIGURATION

 there are two configuration files for penemo (in /usr/local/etc/penemo/).

        penemo.conf - this file covers all of the configuration options
                      that specify how penemo is to run. here is where
		      you also specify the default values for agents,
		      (these values are set if you havent specified
		       otherwise in the agents.conf).

        agent.conf - this file covers the configuration for the agents
                     that penemo is to monitor. here you specify what
                     to monitor for each agent, etc.

 both of these files have fairly detailed comments for each option, in an
 attempt to be self documenting. edit both of these files and set any values
 that may need to be set accordingly to the way your system is configured.

 sometimes the default options in the penemo.conf work fine for what you 
 are doing.

 penemo's html output is (by default) in /usr/local/share/penemo/html you
 can symlink this directory to the directory apache has its htdocs to make
 the html viewable from the web (remote).

 I recommend the following:

        # ln -s /usr/local/share/penemo/html <apache_html_dir>/penemo

 or you can set the html output (dir_html directive) to write directly
 to your webservers html data directory. (for example on debian system
 I set dir_html /var/www/htdocs/penemo/)



RUNNING PENEMO

 penemo is not a daemon, it is meant to be run in a cron job every couple of
 minutes (or however often you want). Before setting up a cron job however
 I recommend running penemo from the command line (as root) and watch the
 output to make sure its running correctly (i.e. has all options it needs 
 set correctly, and the agent.conf file is configured correctly). and
 double check its html output.
 
 this is what i have in my /etc/crontab:

        */5 *  * * *  root  /usr/local/sbin/penemo 2> /dev/null 1> /dev/null

 this configuration runs penemo every 5 minutes and pipes all output to
 /dev/null (otherwise it gets sent to root@localhost I believe).
