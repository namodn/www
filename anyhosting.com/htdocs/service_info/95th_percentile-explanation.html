    <p>What is the 95th percentile, and why is it useful in measuring
    bandwidth? </p>

    <p>The 95th percentile is the smallest number that is greater
    than 95% of the numbers in a given set. The reason this
    statistic is so useful in measuring data throughput is that is
    gives a very accurate picture of the cost of the bandwidth.
    Here's an example. Suppose an ISP sells you a T1 line, but
    you're only using it to access the web. Even though you might
    frequently download very large files (filling the pipe) your
    cost to the ISP is negligible, because your usage is
    intermittent. A single T3 connection to the backbone could
    easily support hundreds of such downstream customers, and never
    become saturated. As another example, suppose you are hosting a
    very busy web site that half-way fills your T1 for several
    hours every day. This type of bandwidth is more expensive,
    because your ISP can't oversell their connection to the
    backbone as effectively. The important thing to realize is that
    it doesn't cost your ISP anything to sell you a pipe of any
    particular size - it is the sustained rate of data transfer
    that costs them money. The sum of the 95th percentile usage of
    all of an ISP's customers predicts the peak amount of backbone
    traffic that the ISP will incur (in a given direction).</p>

    <p>Here are some examples. ISPs must charge for bandwidth by
    one of three means:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Sell a flat rate, possibly bandwidth limited connection,
      and try to sell to customers whose usage patterns are not so
      intese. Nearly all DSL providers do this. The customers like
      it because they don't have to worry about how much bandwidth
      they use, and ISPs like it because it simplifies billing, and
      they make more money as long as they have plenty of low-usage
      customers. The problem, particularly if the ISP is selling
      very fast connections, is that the ISP can become overwhelmed
      by even a small number of high-usage customers. Even
      residential customers can be such high-usage clients, thanks
      to recently popular services such as peer-to-peer file
      sharing.</li>

      <li>Sell a fast connection (eg 100Mbit Ethernet, which is
      inexpensive) and charge for the volume of data transfer - eg
      number of Gigabytes per month. This model works great for web
      sites, which almost always generate traffic in a predictable
      bell curve. However, it severely penalizes customers who use
      bandwidth intermittently. For example, suppose a customer
      runs an automated off-site backup every night. This brief
      usage spurt costs the ISP almost nothing. Although the
      recurring sustained data rate is low, the customer gets
      charged for a huge amount of bandwidth.</li>

      <li>Sell a fast connection and bill by 95th percentile. By
      now this should make sense - it's a fair system where
      everybody pays for what they get. The advantage to the
      customer is that they get the performance of a high-speed
      connection, while paying only for their actual usage. ISPs
      like it because they don't have to worry about high-usage
      customers upsetting their overselling ratios.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Irrespective of billing concerns, the 95th percentile is a
    very interesting and useful figure. Bottom line is it tells you
    how much of your connection you're really using (and really
    need).</p>
