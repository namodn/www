    <h1>AnyHosting Website Lifecycle</h1>
    <h3>Author: Robert Helmer <a href="mailto:rhelmer@anyhosting.com">rhelmer@anyhosting.com</a></h3>
    <b>The idea</b>
    <p>Every great web site starts with a great idea. Mockups of the content,
    a prototype web application, etc. But how do you take that project
    from the larval stage to a production site able to handle tons of
    traffic?</p>
    <p><b>Start small</b></p>
    <p>Before you can start driving traffic to your site, you need to
    have a basic web presence. 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_hosting">Virtual hosting</a>
    is a great place to start, as the price is low (~$5/mo) and doesn't
    require a large outlay of time or expertise. If you're not going to
    hire a professional designer from the start, the best advice is to
    keep it simple. You can also find many free web hosts, but they tend
    to be ad-supported (requiring you to put ads on your pages that you
    do not get paid for) or restrict the type of content you can upload.
    If you want to have total control over the user experience for your
    web site, the ability to run your own ads if you like, and access to
    support, it's worth a small investment.</p>
    <p><b>Too big for it's britches</b></p>
    <p>Virtual hosting is not without it's drawbacks; you're not going to 
    get the flexibility to install whatever you need, and sharing the same
    machine with other budding sites reduces the total number of simultaneous
    visitors you can have, and makes your response time less predictable.</p>
    <p>The next step is one or more
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">Virtual
    Private Servers</a>, or VPS. This gives you the flexibility to install
    whatever software you like, without needing to maintain your own machines,
    power, network connectivity, and maintenance costs. These services go 
    for around $15-$30, and generally include 24-hour uptime guarantees and
    access to support. If you don't have (and don't want) experience 
    administering your own server, you'll want to find a reputable consultant.
    </p>
    <p><i>More after the break.</i></p>

    <p><b>The big leagues</b></p>
    <p>Hosting your own servers in a datacenter. Many companies jump to this 
    stage sooner than need be, but it certainly does give you complete 
    flexibility. The cost is much generally much higher (~$100 or more per
    month, increasing as you add more servers, power, and network connectivity
    costs). The benefit is that as you grow you'll want the ability to 
    negotiate deals; your cost per machine goes down as you go from 5 to 10
    to 100 servers, which is not something you generally see with the Virtual
    plans. However, you'll need full-time support in case something goes
    wrong, and that means either a full-time employee or on-call contractor.
    </p> 
    <p>You'll also need to handle your own backups, monitoring, etc. that
    a virtual host or VPS provider generally handle for you. Again you get
    more flexibility, but nothing is worse for your site than losing your
    users' data, or not being there when your user needs you, so you or 
    someone on your staff needs to be sure of your contingency plans.
    </p>
    <p><b>Where to go from here</b></p>
    <p>How do you choose where to start? A good web hosting company can
    help you decide where you are in this lifecycle, and how to get to
    the next step. A great one will also point you in the right direction, even
    if that means sending you to their competitor.</p>
