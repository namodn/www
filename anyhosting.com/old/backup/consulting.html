<FONT COLOR="#FAB133">Namodn Computer Consulting is a small consulting
business in the San
Francisco Bay Area. We enjoy working with computers and solving
computer
related problems. If something is wrong with your system we guarantee that
we can either fix the problem right there, or diagnose the problem, whether
it turns out to be a hardware or a software problem. From there you can
decide whether you want to buy a new part and have us install it (if it is a 
hardware problem), re-configure your software, or do nothing at
all.<BR></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#AAFF76">Building Custom Systems</FONT> - We can put together
a system based on what you
need and don't need. Putting systems together this way allows us to get
you what you need, without charging you for what you dont. For example:
someone who needs a computer for internet connectivity, office work, etc. doesn't
 need to buy a system with the fastest video card,
optimized for game play and high resolution graphics. That would just be a
waste of money. They also wouldn't necessarily need a high end sound card.
These components go unused by someone who does not require the cutting edge of
 multimedia graphics and sound. We can put a system together that has what you 
need (not what you don't)
 and we can offer it to you for the lowest price possible, since we buy all
the parts individually.<BR>
<P> 
<FONT COLOR="#AAFF76">Local Area Networks</FONT> - We can get your office,
or home, set up with a local area network. We can go in and set the
network up with computers you already have, or we can start from scratch
and go over with you what your price range and needs are, purchase and put
together the systems and set the network up. We can install the
network using a Windows NT, or Linux/FreeBSD server. It doesn't matter
what kind of operating system you run on your client end computers
(Windows 95/98, Macintosh, or Unix based systems all work fine).<FONT

installation</FONT>.
